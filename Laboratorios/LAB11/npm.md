# NPM for website

## Tips

### Locally install the packages

```powershell
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm install --save express
```

Thankfully if you install locally, you'll be able to see the changes in versions to see when a update made it break.

### Check the package.json

### Do not version the files in node modules
