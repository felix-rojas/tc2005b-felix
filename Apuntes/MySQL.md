# XAMPP

## Apache

Apache is a web server, most servers use Apache

When we make the http module require and listen it automatically generates the server

Apache has to be enabled within XAMPP

Apache has Unix architecture and the configuration comes in the const folder within /etc

### Disadvantages

Whn you work locally it's p nice but whne you push it to the server config. You have to continously make config fles and identify the differences between local and remote.

Package.json with npm within node allows us to config itself so we dont have to do it EVERY time.

## node

Node has the configuration within the same file

## phpmyadmin

This is the web application to manage the SQL queries and database. 



## MySQL

Uses the port 3306 by default
MySQL is such a good competitor that Oracle bought MySQL

This was then forked into MariaDB
