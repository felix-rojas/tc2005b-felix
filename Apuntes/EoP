# Event oriented programming

## DOM

The DOM an be interfaced through the document by using functions like getElemeent. ou can see the dom within the Website inspector.

### Good practice

>Research code smells

-Make everything step by step and verify each one of them. It's easier to develop faster when trying to find errors.
-The "alt" attribute is absolutely necesary for accesibility and should *ALWAYS* be used
-Three strike rule: If this is the **third** time you are writing it, **refactor** the code
-Take a 10/15 minute break to refactorize code
-Only refactorize after code is more functional, not when it just worked
-Quality code is EASY to modify
-Use onkeyup preferrably when listening to keyboard events to avoid bugs. onkeydown it stays behind so it doesn't show the current input.
